Hi! I am currently a third year undergraduate in Mathematics Department at [IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/maths/). My academic interests lie in subjects of statistics, machine learning and topics in theoretical computer science. I will be working as a research intern at [Adobe](https://research.adobe.com/careers/bangalore/) this summer. I am also trying to run a [MathSoc](https://www.instagram.com/mathsoc_iitg/) in my institute and in my free time, I am involved in a lot of [stuff](https://u-d-ash.github.io/Bloggo/) !
